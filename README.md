The dataset is represented by details of many AirBnb's across Europe such as prices, location coordinates, number of rooms etc.

I have employed multiple libraries to create static and interractive plots and better visualize the data (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, folium).

Screenshots with the interactive plots can be seen in the folder "screenshots_data_viz"
